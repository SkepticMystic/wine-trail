  <p>
    Yoga List is an online platform that offers a comprehensive directory for
    yoga teachers, studios and events in South Africa. Additionally, it serves
    as an advertising platform for yoga events, workshops, retreats, and teacher
    trainings. By using our platform, users are required to agree to the
    following terms and conditions. Applicants seeking to join our directory
    must provide accurate information, and any misuse of the platform or
    submission of misleading information may result in suspension or termination
    of their profile, without any refunds. All information submitted is screened
    and accepted before publication, and any misleading or incorrect content may
    be omitted. Yoga List does not endorse or make representations about the
    quality of the listed teachers, events, or studios.
  </p>

  <p>
    Applicants are responsible for maintaining up-to-date and accurate
    information on their profiles and ensuring professional conduct when dealing
    with referrals from the platform. Listings on the directory require yearly
    advance payment, and terminated listings will not receive refunds.
    Additionally, applicants are accountable for handling bookings, orders, and
    payments related to their listings. They must have legal rights to the
    images, videos, or products they submit, and Yoga List reserves the right to
    remove any content from the website. Event hosts have similar
    responsibilities, including providing accurate information, maintaining
    professional conduct, and promptly notifying Yoga List of any changes,
    rescheduling, or cancellations. Changes made to advertised events may incur
    additional fees. It is the responsibility of hosts to submit event
    applications in a timely manner; failure to do so may result in
    non-advertisement without refunds.
  </p>

  <p>
    Teachers, studios, and event hosts have the right to request insights into
    their social media and newsletter posts until the event's start date. They
    are also entitled to follow up on unfulfilled advertising packages. While
    Yoga List is not liable for any misconduct between visitors or clients and
    event hosts, inappropriate or harmful comments can be deleted by the
    platform. The submission of events for advertising must adhere to the
    recommended times, and events submitted with shorter notice may have
    limitations on their advertising package. Yoga List does not guarantee
    bookings and decides advertising based on various factors. Listings are
    removed after the respective events or trainings have concluded.
  </p>

    As for the product directory, Yoga List does not guarantee product sales and
    is not responsible for orders, payments, refunds, or returns. External links
    are provided for convenience, but Yoga List holds no liability for their

    payment should be sent to the platform. Yoga List disclaims liability for
    any loss, damage, or personal injury resulting from the use of the website
    or the submitted personal information. All content, trademarks, and data on
